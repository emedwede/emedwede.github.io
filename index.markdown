## About
My PhD in Computational Science is jointly awarded from San Diego State University and UC Irvine and my research focused on using computational methods to understand and model complex biological systems. In particular, I developed software and algoirthms to simulate Dynamical Graph Grammars for the cortical microtubule array in plant cells and improve their performance. 

I also had the great opportunity to gain valuable experience in scientific computing and HPC through internships at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory, where I worked on projects involving plasma physics, machine learning, and asteroid detection. I have published a first author paper in the journal of Physical Biology, and another paper is currently avaible on arXiv, and in the past I have contributed to a workshop paper on performance portability in Fortran, along with editorial review of a computer vision paper published to IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems.
